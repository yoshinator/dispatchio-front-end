# DISPATCHIO
Dispatchio is an application that allows businesses with a mobile workforce to dispatch their team members and get updates of the jobs they're doing. Built using React and Redux on the front end and Ruby on Rails on the backend. It uses JSON Web Tokens for authorization. The app has two views, one for managers and owners that presents a dashboard and a view for employees that only shows the jobs they are assigned to.

THIS IS THE FRONT END TO [DISPATCHIO.IO](http://dispatchio.io) REST API can be found at [https://github.com/yoshinator/dispatchio-backend](https://github.com/yoshinator/dispatchio-backend)

 You must have the backend rails server running for full functionallity on port 3000. Check the [Api Adapter](https://github.com/yoshinator/dispatchio-front-end/blob/master/src/adapters/ApiAdapter.js) to make sure the endpoint matches your settings on your environment for proper setup.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
